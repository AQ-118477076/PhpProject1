        <h1>Autonomous Things</h1>
        <p>The emergence of autonomous things over the last few years, I believe, has been an exciting development within technology that is only going to become more innovative and more and more exciting as time goes on. 
            Driven by the likes of big data, AI and cloud technologies, I have no doubt that – as these technologies advance – autonomous things are only going to continue to advance at a break neck speed.
            The future of autonomous things relies heavily on the continued research and development behind big data, AI and cloud technologies. I can imagine it’s an exciting time to be an architect working in this world which is only going to explode in popularity as time goes by. 
            I’d love to hear from any architects who might be lucky enough to be exploring this technology already…
