        <h1>Aghada Ladies Gaelic Football Club</h1>
        <p>I am a proud member of Aghada Ladies Gaelic football Club. <br />
           I have been playing Football with Aghada since I was six years old, <br />
           I love being part of a team as i have grown up playing and going to school with the girls on my team. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
           Our team has had a very successful two years, in 2017 we won the Junior All Ireland Final,<br />
           We have since progressed from an intermediate team to a senior team in the last year,<br />
           Being part of a team is an amazing team and is an even better feeling when you are winning as a team. <br />
           
        </p>
