        <h1>Blockchain Technology</h1>
        <p>The Bitcoin Network is the first successful implementation of blockchain technology. The term "blockchain technology" typically refers to the transparent, trustless, publicly accessible ledger that allows us to securely transfer the ownership of units of value using public key encryption and proof of work methods.
            The technology uses decentralized consensus to maintain the network, which means it is not centrally controlled by a bank, corporation, or government. In fact, the larger the network grows and becomes increasingly decentralized, the more secure it becomes. 
The potential for blockchain technology is not limited to bitcoin. As such, it has gained a lot of attention in a variety of industries including: financial services, charities and nonprofits, the arts, and e-commerce.
A typical blockchain system consists of two types of records- transaction and blocks. Transactions are the actions carried out in a particular period and are stored together in a block. What makes blockchain unique is that each block contains a cryptographic hash that links them to the previous transactions creating a compact string of transactions. All participants can see the block and can verify or reject transactions using consensus algorithms. All the approved data is recorded into the ledger as part of a block and secured through cryptography. These chains are impossible to predict, which makes it easy to detect any tampering.
