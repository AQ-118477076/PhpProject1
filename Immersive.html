        <h1>Immersive Experiences</h1>
        <p>The three pillars of immersive experiences are visual quality, sound quality, and intuitive interactions. Full immersion can only be achieved by simultaneously focusing on these pillars.
            Immersive experiences like virtual, augmented and mixed reality could transform how we interact with the world – from advertising to film, music and museums.
To ensure these experiences meet customer needs, £1 million in funding has been awarded to 32 projects which will use human-centred design (design focused on user requirements) to create new immersive experiences, products and services.
The successful projects will use customer research to generate ideas, and create and test low-cost prototypes. The best ideas will progress to further technical research and development (R&D).
The successful projects are part of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund’s audience of the future programme, which is delivered by UK Research and Innovation. Through this programme, government is supporting the best UK storytellers to create engaging immersive experiences.
