        <h1>Vietnam</h1>
        <p>In July 2018, My family & I visited Vietnam & Cambodia for two weeks. <br />
           We visited many parts of Vietnam including Hanoi, Hoi An, Ho Chi Minh and Ha Long Bay. <br />
           Vietnam is enriched with History following The Vietnam War. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
           The weather was extremely humid due to the time of year that we visited, <br />
           It was extremely eye-opening and fascinating to experience such a different culture to our own. <br />
           Vietnam was amazing and I hope to travel Asia a lot more when I am older. <br />
